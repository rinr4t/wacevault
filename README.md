# ~~Mace~~ War Club Vault
This Github repository contains many resources relevant to WACE. This includes past tests and exams from different schools and past WACE exams. We currently are unable to host textbooks due to their size and copyright concerns. If you want copies of the textbooks, there are many other places where they can be found.<br><br>
This repository currently includes the following subjects:
- Maths Methods (AEMAM & ATMAM)
- Maths Specialist (AEMAS & ATMAS)
- Physics (AEPHY & ATPHY)
- Chemistry (AECHE & ATCHE)
<br><br>

If you want to download only a specific folder, you can use this link: https://download-directory.github.io. We are not connected to this project, but it makes downloading these resources much easier.
